How does Atlan use tags and policies to manage access to sensitive data?,"Atlan uses tags and policies by allowing users to define an access policy that restricts access to assets based on a specific tag, such as 'PII'. These tags can be configured to automatically propagate downstream to any derived assets, ensuring that the access control is also automatically applied to them.","Atlan utilizes tags and policies to manage access to sensitive data through a combination of organized classification and granular access controls. Admin users can create tags to classify data assets based on important characteristics, allowing for better organization and management (Source: https://docs.atlan.com/product/capabilities/governance/tags/concepts/what-are-tags). These tags can be used to group different assets together and apply specific access policies to those groups, facilitating compliance with regulations such as GDPR and CCPA by identifying assets that require special handling (Source: https://docs.atlan.com/product/capabilities/governance/tags/concepts/what-are-tags). 

Additionally, Atlan employs granular access policies that can be defined for both users and groups, controlling actions a user can take against various assets, from entire databases down to individual columns. This allows organizations to restrict access to sensitive data, ensuring that data governance policies align with organizational goals and compliance requirements (Source: https://docs.atlan.com/platform/concepts/authentication-and-authorization).","['Identity and access management\u200b\nFor centralized management of groups and users, Atlan uses granular access policies.\nAdmins can define policies to control both which actions a user can take and against which assets.

How does Atlan handle data and metadata persistence?,"Atlan is a virtualized solution that does not move or store your data. It crawls metadata from upstream sources and stores that metadata in a secure VPC, while data queries are pushed directly to the existing storage layers.","Atlan handles data and metadata persistence by processing metadata that reaches its SaaS tenant and storing it in the Atlan metastore, making it searchable and governable. Importantly, Atlan does not move or store the actual data from existing storage layers; instead, it crawls metadata from upstream data sources and stores this metadata in a secure virtual private cloud (VPC). When queries are made, Atlan pushes them to existing processing layers, such as databases or data warehouses, ensuring that the original data remains in place (Source: https://docs.atlan.com/platform/concepts/data-and-metadata-persistence).","['Data and metadata persistence | Atlan Documentation', 'Processing and persistence in Atlan: Once the metadata reaches your Atlan SaaS tenant, it gets processed by Atlan workflows and persisted in the Atlan metastore where it becomes searchable and governable.', ""Skip to main contentSearchPartner with usWhat's newSupport portalContact supportGet startedConnect dataUse dataBuild governanceConfigure AtlanGet StartedWhat is Atlan?Quick Start GuidesCore ConceptsAuthentication and authorizationData and metadata persistenceEncryption and key managementHigh availability and disaster recovery (HA/DR)AdministrationSecurity & ComplianceReferencesFAQsGet StartedCore ConceptsData and metadata persistenceOn this pageData and metadata persistenceAtlan is a fully virtualized solution that does not involve moving data from existing storage layers.

Where does Atlan store asset metadata and user data?,"Atlan stores asset metadata in Apache Atlas, Elasticsearch, and Cassandra. It stores user data, including roles and groups, in its own PostgreSQL database.","Atlan stores asset metadata in several locations: 
- **Apache Atlas**, which is a graph database layer that stores entity relationships and attributes; 
- **Elasticsearch**, which optimizes search capabilities within the product; and 
- **Cassandra**, which serves as the persistence back-end for this metadata (Source: https://docs.atlan.com/platform/concepts/data-and-metadata-persistence).  

For user data, Atlan utilizes its own **PostgreSQL database** to store information about users, roles, and groups. Additionally, **Keycloak** leverages this data for access and identity management.

What is Atlan's process for disaster recovery if a tenant needs to be recreated?,"In case of a disaster, Atlan automates the recreation of a tenant by onboarding a new one, restoring data from the last backup using Argo Workflows, scaling down the old tenant, updating the domain and Cloudflare records, with the entire process taking around 3-4 hours.","Atlan's disaster recovery process involves several automated actions to restore a tenant in the event of a disaster. When a disaster is detected, the Disaster Assessment Team is notified and evaluates the situation to prioritize remediation based on critical services. To restore a tenant, Atlan performs the following actions:

1. **Recreation of the Tenant**: The tenant is recreated as part of the recovery actions.
2. **Automated Backup Restoration**: All components of the tenant are restored from backup, which typically takes around 3-4 hours.

"How does Atlan handle data when a user runs a query, and is the data stored in Atlan?","Atlan does not store or cache data. When a query is run, it pushes a SQL query directly to the underlying source database. The results are encrypted in transit, and Atlan applies access policies before displaying them.","Atlan handles data by pushing all queries directly to the underlying source database, meaning that it does not store or cache any data within the platform. Each time a user runs a query, Atlan streams the results in real-time from the data source, ensuring that the displayed data is always up to date and accurate (Source: https://docs.atlan.com/platform/concepts/data-and-metadata-persistence). Atlan does not move or store the actual data; it operates by accessing the data where it resides (Source: https://docs.atlan.com/faq/basic-platform-usage). 

In terms of storage, Atlan only stores the metadata it collects and creates, which is kept within a secure VPC (virtual private cloud). This metadata includes information about data assets but not the actual data itself (Source: https://docs.atlan.com/platform/concepts/data-and-metadata-persistence). Therefore, Atlan serves primarily as a metadata catalog rather than a data storage solution (Source: https://docs.atlan.com/platform/concepts/data-and-metadata-persistence).","[""How does Atlan access the data for queries?\u200b\nAtlan pushes all queries to the source.

What are the steps and prerequisites for enabling Atlan event logs in an AWS S3 bucket?,"To enable event logs in AWS, the customer's S3 bucket must have versioning enabled, and they must provide their account ID, bucket name, and region. Atlan then provides a bucket policy for the customer to attach, after which Atlan support completes the final configuration.","To enable Atlan event logs in an AWS S3 bucket, follow these steps and prerequisites:

### Prerequisites
1. **Enable Bucket Versioning**: Both the source and destination S3 buckets must have versioning enabled. Refer to the AWS documentation for instructions on how to enable versioning.
2. **Provide Bucket Details**: You need to supply the following information to Atlan:
   - Account ID
   - Bucket name
   - Region
   Atlan will use these details to create an IAM role and provide you with a bucket policy that must be attached to your S3 bucket.

### Steps to Enable Event Logs
1. **Attach the Bucket Policy**: Once you receive the bucket policy from Atlan, attach it to your S3 bucket. This policy is crucial for allowing Atlan to access the logs.
2. **Confirm Policy Attachment**: After you have attached the bucket policy, confirm this with Atlan. This step ensures that Atlan can proceed with the final configuration.
3. **Final Configuration by Atlan**: Atlan support will complete the setup of log replication to your S3 bucket after the policy is confirmed to be attached.

### Setting Up the S3 Bucket
- Ensure that the query files are available in the S3 bucket. You can either upload these files to the Atlan deployment bucket or use your own S3 bucket.
- To avoid access issues, it is recommended to upload the required files to the same S3 bucket as Atlan. You may need to raise a support request to obtain the details of your Atlan bucket.
- Configure access by adding the following IAM policy to the default EC2 instance role used by the Atlan EKS cluster:
  ```json
  {
    ""Version"": ""2012-10-17"",
    ""Statement"": [
      {
        ""Sid"": ""VisualEditor0"",
        ""Effect"": ""Allow"",
        ""Action"": [
          ""s3:GetBucketLocation"",
          ""s3:ListBucket"",
          ""s3:GetObject""
        ],
        ""Resource"": [
          ""arn:aws:s3:::<bucket-name>"",
          ""arn:aws:s3:::<bucket-name>/<prefix>/*""
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

### Continuous Replication
- Application audit logs will be streamed to Atlan's S3 bucket in near real-time (within 10 seconds of generation). Once these logs are available in Atlan's bucket, they will be replicated to your organization's S3 bucket within 15 minutes, ensuring ongoing and timely access to the logs (Source: https://docs.atlan.com/platform/references/cloud-logging-and-monitoring).","['Secure delivery- Logs are encrypted in transit and at rest, with mechanisms to validate data integrity.\n\n\nCustomer access: Logs are easily accessible through S3 or GCS, allowing for a flexible monitoring and alerting setup.\n\n\nEnabling event logs in AWS\u200b\n\nPrerequisites\u200b\n\nEnable bucket versioning.

1. **Atlan API Token**: Create an Atlan API token and assign a persona to it.

2. **Metadata Policy**: Add a metadata policy that provides the necessary permissions on assets for the Atlan action to function correctly. For instance:
   - Asset (e.g., a table): Read only
   - Any downstream connections (e.g., Microsoft Power BI): Read only

3. **GITHUB_TOKEN Permissions**: Configure the default `GITHUB_TOKEN` permissions in your repository to grant read and write access. This enables the Atlan action to add or update comments on pull requests.

4. **Repository Secrets**: Create the following repository secrets:
   - `ATLAN_INSTANCE_URL`: The URL of your Atlan instance.
   - `ATLAN_API_TOKEN`: The value of the API token you created.

What are the main steps to generate and securely provide troubleshooting files to Atlan support using Google Chrome?,"First, open the Developer Tools, start recording in the 'Network' tab, and then replicate the issue. Next, save the console log from the 'Console' tab and the HAR file from the 'Network' tab. Finally, it is recommended to edit the HAR file in a text editor to remove any sensitive information like passwords before uploading both files.","To generate and securely provide troubleshooting files to Atlan support using Google Chrome, follow these main steps:

1. **Launch Google Chrome** and navigate to the relevant webpage.

2. In the upper-right corner, click the three vertical dots to open the Chrome menu.

3. Select **More Tools**, then click **Developer Tools**.

4. In the Developer Tools, go to the **Network** tab and set the filtering option to **Fetch/XHR**.

5. Click **Preserve log** under the Network tab to start recording the network log (a red circle will appear). If it is black, click it to turn it red.

6. Refresh the webpage to allow Chrome to record interactions between the browser and the website.

7. Once the page loads, click the circle slash icon next to the red circle to clear the logs.

8. Replicate the issue you experienced (for instance, perform the action that triggers the error) so that the error is captured in the console.

9. After replicating the issue, navigate to the **Console** tab, right-click in the console box, select **Save as...**, and name your file.

10. **Edit the HAR file** in a text editor to remove any sensitive information before sending it to Atlan support, as HAR files can contain sensitive data like passwords and private keys (Source: https://docs.atlan.com/platform/how-tos/generate-har-files-and-console-logs).","['Console or network logs frequently provide critical error details that are required to determine the underlying cause of the issue or bug that you are experiencing.\nHAR files include all the network traffic from when you started recording, including sensitive information like passwords and private keys.

How can you ensure that column data types are correctly displayed for both dbt Cloud and dbt Core models in Atlan?,"For dbt Cloud, you must enable the 'Generate docs on run' option for at least one job run in every environment. For dbt Core, you need to upload the `manifest.json` and `catalog.json` files that are generated by the `dbt docs generate` command.","To ensure that column data types are correctly displayed for both dbt Cloud and dbt Core models in Atlan, you need to follow specific steps for each environment:

1. **For dbt Cloud:** Make sure that there is at least one job run with the ""Generate docs on run"" option enabled for every environment where dbt models are executed. This is necessary for Atlan to correctly crawl and display column data types (Source: https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/etl-tools/dbt/references/what-does-atlan-crawl-from-dbt-cloud).

2. **For dbt Core:** You must upload the `manifest.json` and `catalog.json` files generated by the `dbt docs generate` command for every dbt Core project. This ensures that Atlan can access the necessary metadata to display the column data types (Source: https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/etl-tools/dbt/references/what-does-atlan-crawl-from-dbt-core).","[""Why are my dbt Cloud models not showing up in Atlan after setup?\u200b\nAtlan only crawls dbt assets that are in the âappliedâ (built) state in dbt Cloud. Models must be part of a successful run to be picked up during crawling; models that are only defined in your project files but havenât been executed wonât be included.

What are two reasons some dbt tests might be missing or why the test count might differ between Atlan and dbt?,"Some dbt tests might be missing because Atlan does not support tests with an auto-generated `unique_id` longer than 32,000 characters. Additionally, the test count can differ because Atlan fetches assets from the 'applied state' of an environment, which may not match the asset count in the manifest files from individual job runs.","Two reasons some dbt tests might be missing or why the test count might differ between Atlan and dbt are:

1. **Character Limit on Unique IDs**: Atlan doesn't support crawling dbt tests with an auto-generated unique_id that exceeds the character limit of 32,000 characters. To catalog such dbt tests in Atlan, users need to define a custom name for their dbt tests within this character limit (Source: https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/etl-tools/dbt/troubleshooting/troubleshooting-dbt-connectivity).

2. **Processing Limitations**: For dbt Core, Atlan currently only processes the status of dbt tests (passed, failed, and warning) but not the job name and execution time, which is available for dbt Cloud. This can lead to discrepancies in the reported test counts between the two platforms (Source: https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/etl-tools/dbt).","['Why is there a discrepancy in dbt test count between dbt and Atlan?\u200b\nAtlan fetches dbt models, sources, and tests from the applied state of each dbt environment.
